# Privacy Policy for Chess Trainer
Effective Date: January 21, 2026

Joel DeVenzke ("I", "Me", or "the Developer") built the Chess Trainer app as a Free app with optional paid subscriptions. This service is provided at no cost and is intended for use as is.

1. Information Collection and Use

I do not collect, store, or share any personal information.

No User Accounts: You do not need to create an account to use the app.

No Personal Data: I do not have access to your name, email address, phone number, or physical location.

Local Storage: Any chess puzzles, progress, or settings are stored locally on your device or via your private iCloud storage (if enabled by you). I cannot see this data.

2. In-App Purchases and Subscriptions

Chess Trainer offers auto-renewable subscriptions using Apple’s StoreKit 2 framework.

Payment Processing: All payments are processed securely by Apple. I never see or store your credit card details, bank information, or billing address.

Transaction Receipts: When you subscribe, Apple provides the app with a cryptographically signed transaction receipt. This is used solely to verify your subscription status and unlock "Chess Trainer" premium features.

Data Handling: This purchase information is linked to your Apple ID by Apple, not by me. I do not link these transactions to any other identifying information.

3. Third-Party Services

The app does not use any third-party analytics, advertising networks, or tracking SDKs.

4. Your Rights

Since I do not collect or store your data, there is no data for me to delete or export. You can manage or cancel your subscriptions at any time through your App Store Account Settings.
